# ConnectNewsFeed

Develop a news feed web application using the features of .net MVC  4.

The News feed, which initially displays a list of 5 news items, will have a “load more” button that will dynammically load additional news items. This should be done using some form of JavaScript.

Given these requirements, your data source should contain around 15 news items.

The data for the web application can use simple “POCO” objects. There is no requirement for it to be data driven from an external source (e.g. database or a data file). Although consideration for making the means of getting the data as general as possible would be highly desirable.
